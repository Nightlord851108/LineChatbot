    "Scrum": "Scrum is a popular agile process which has a lot of advantage for developing software. In scrum process, there's several primary stat, including deviding stories, sprint planning, during a sprint, daily scrum, sprint demo, sprint retrospective, for team members to follow and work in a short period for a small goal. In scrum process, we don't want to face a complex large problem directly, instead, we divide the big problems into some small stories and tasks, so we easily solve many simple questions in a sprint(working period in scrum). It's a very good method for working efficiently. To know more detail, you could access following website, https://www.scrum.tw/new/index.php. ",
    "Pair Programming": "Pare programming or mob programming is to write code with one or more co-workers sitting beside you, who's focus on same view of program you were fucused on. There'll be one driver, who handle the keyboard and mouse to type, and one or more navigators, who think of how to write the code and tell the driver. Although this method seems very inefficiency, it actually let team members collaborate very well, since they really working together. The biggest advantage of this method is that since everyone knows the entire structure of the system they built, there is going to be very little even zero conflict when they merge all the code together, while in traditional collaboration, people ofthen faced dozens or hundreds of conflict of mergin each others code together, which is true inefficiency, not to metion there's going to generate numberless bugs while fixing conflict.
